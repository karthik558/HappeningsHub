# Birthday Project

A simple web application that displays the names and company of employees who are celebrating their birthdays on the current day. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate a grid of images with the employees' names and companies displayed underneath. The project also features a fun balloon animation effect that duplicates the balloon image on all sides of the grid.
